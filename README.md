# Buying-tickets-Fast-and-Automatically
This is a individual project of course EE551(Python), and the author of it is Yarong Liu 


## Introduction
Nowadays more and more people prefer to buy tickets, like air tickets, train tickets, on the website. But there are always some bad situations that our favorite tickets or the tickets fit our schedule have been sold out. In this case, what we really want to have is a monitor, which could help us monitor whether the website have a seat that fit the requirement of customer at every second, if the monitor finds this specific ticket, it could place the order fast and automatically. This project is to using Python to create a machine helping customers buy train tickets what they want automatically

## Future Plan
If I could achieve the basic function in advance, I will try my best to achieve other functions as following:
* Automatically log in ticketing website.
* Send email or message to customers when the machine monitor the ticket which fits customer requirement.
* Simultaneously monitor different kind of train tickets.
* Do another similar project which help customers buying discounted product successfully in a very short time.
