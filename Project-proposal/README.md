## [Introduction](#Introduction)
Nowadays more and more people prefer to buy tickets, like air tickets, train tickets, on the website. But there are always some bad situations that our favorite tickets or the tickets fit our schedule have been sold out. In this case, what we really want to have is a monitor, which could help us monitor whether the website have a seat that fit the requirement of passengers at every second, if the monitor finds this specific ticket, it could place the order fast and automatically. This project is to using Python to create a machine helping passengers buy train tickets what they want automatically

### functions
* Automatically open and switch the website we want. 
* Automatically input departure, destination and data.
* Read kinds of information on the website.
* Press the specific buttons on the website.
* Automatically add information of passengers.


## [Future-Plan](#Future-Plan)
If I could achieve the basic function in advance, I will try my best to achieve other functions as following:
* Send email or message to customers when the machine monitor the ticket which fits passenger requirement.
* Simultaneously monitor different kind of train tickets.
* Do another similar project which help customers buying discounted product successfully in a very short time.
